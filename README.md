About the Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about orders and revenue. The key features include:

Id: Unique ​​identifier for each order Order_Placed: Number of orders placed Name: Name of the product Franchise: Franchise associated with the product Category: Category of the product City: City where the order was placed Revenue: Revenue generated from the order No_Of_Item: Number of items in the order

Data Preprocessing
Loading Data:
Loaded the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for inspection.

Handling Missing Values:
Checked for and handled missing values in the dataset.

Data Type Conversion:
Ensured that numerical features were correctly typed.

Dropping Irrelevant Columns:
Dropped columns that were not relevant to the analysis: Name, Franchise, Category, and City.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive Statistics:
Reviewed the basic statistics and structure of the dataset.

Box Plots and Histograms:
Created box plots and histograms for numerical features to check for outliers and understand their distributions.

Implementing Linear Regression
Feature and Target Selection:
Selected features (X) and target (Y) for the model.

Data Splitting:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets using a 70-30 split.

Training the Linear Regression Model:
Trained a Linear Regression model using the training data.

Predicting on Test Data:
Predicted the revenue for the test data using the trained model.

Model Performance Evaluation
Error Analysis:
Created a DataFrame to compare actual and predicted values and calculate errors.

Scatter Plots:
Created scatter plots to visualize actual vs. predicted values for Id and Order_Placed.

R2 Score:
Calculated the R2 score to evaluate the model's performance.

Conclusion
The analysis demonstrated the application of Linear Regression for predicting revenue. Key findings include:

The Linear Regression model provided a reasonable prediction for revenue based on the features. The model performance was evaluated using error analysis, scatter plots, and R2 score. The accuracy was lower due to the limited size of the dataset, suggesting the need for more data or additional methods like feature scaling. These insights highlight the utility of Linear Regression in regression tasks and the importance of data quality and quantity in building effective models. This approach can be applied to various scenarios where predicting numerical outcomes is crucial for business decisions
